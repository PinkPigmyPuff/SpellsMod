    Ideally this would be the default code for all Spells
    All other Spells would extend this class
    It should essentially:
        0. Set default code for all spells
        1. Register all the spells
            - This should set the cooldown, mana cost, etc
        2. Have an 'active' spell slot
        3. When a spell is cast, call the 'active' spell
